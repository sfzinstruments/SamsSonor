# SamsSonor

## Description

From the Sam Greene's [original website]:

> This is my Sonor Force 3001 sampled and painstakingly placed into EXS24.
There at least 4 velocity levels for each sound. Many more for the snare and kick.

> The snare has a left and right hand so you can play rolls on D-1 and E-2 easily.
There is also a snare drum with snares off down below the kick at A-1 and G-0.

> CC Share and share alike.

Mapped by kinwie using sfz format v2 with ARIA extensions.
